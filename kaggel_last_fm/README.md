This dataset is a summarized, sanitized subset of the one released at The 2nd International Workshop on Information Heterogeneity and Fusion in Recommender Systems (HetRec 2011), currently hosted at the GroupLens website (here).

Sanitization included: (a) artist name mispelling correction and standardization; (b) reassignment of artists referenced with two or more artist id's; (c) removal of artists listed as 'unknown' or through their website addresses.

The original dataset contains a larger number of files, including tag-related information, in addition to users, artists and scrobble counts. last.fm was contacted by the author and asked for some recent version of this content, in similar format, with no return until June 15th, 2020.
