Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.

We have several target features, but let us work only with toxic in this data because of kernel limits (and try to use simple models - now voting classifiers - only RandomForest, SGD and try some BERT)

Due to the computational limitations of the kernel - i have to abandon voting during classification and choose only one target feature. I hope the procedure will be useful to someone. It is just a baseline for beginners, thank you for reading
